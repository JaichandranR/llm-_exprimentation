While the application pods include a logging-sidecar running Fluent Bit v2.2.3 for log collection and forwarding, the configuration was not fully onboarded during the migration from the legacy environment to the new Foundation Service Stack.

Current State:

Fluent Bit is deployed in each pod, reading logs from /data/trino/var/log/.

Configuration mounts (fluent-bit.conf) are present, and the PPA_HOST endpoint is defined.

However, integration with the centralized logging platform has not been fully completed — logs may not yet be indexed or retained in the target Splunk/Foundation stack environment.

Reason:

During the migration, log forwarding setup was partially migrated from the legacy stack but not fully validated or registered in the new platform’s ingestion pipelines.

Additional onboarding steps (e.g., platform registration, index creation, access control) were deferred to a later phase.

Impact:

Logs may still be available in local PVC storage for short-term buffering but are not guaranteed to be captured in the centralized logging system for long-term retention or compliance.

This could result in gaps in log visibility for troubleshooting, auditing, or monitoring until onboarding is completed.
