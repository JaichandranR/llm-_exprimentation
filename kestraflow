Expected Growth:
Based on current adoption trends and upcoming data platform integrations:

Query Volume: Expected to increase by 20–30% over the next 6 months as more analytics teams onboard to the Trino service.

Data Volume: Anticipated 25–40% growth in S3-based processed datasets as additional data sources are integrated.

Cluster Scaling: The HPA configuration allows worker pods to scale up to 30, which can accommodate projected growth without changes to baseline node capacity.

Storage Needs: Additional PVC allocation may be required for worker spill space if growth exceeds 40%, particularly during concurrent heavy workloads.

Long-term: Monitoring trends over the next 3–6 months will determine whether permanent baseline capacity adjustments are needed.

Expected Growth (6–12 Months):
The Trino deployment is currently in the process of migrating from the legacy GKP instance to the Foundation Service Stack. As the migration progresses:

Query Volume: Overall query volume on this environment is expected to gradually reduce as workloads are shifted to the Foundation Service Stack.

Data Volume: Processed data volume stored in associated PVCs and S3 locations will also decrease over time as datasets are re-pointed or migrated.

Decommissioning Plan: Once all consumers have fully transitioned to the Foundation Service Stack, this legacy deployment will be decommissioned, eliminating the need for ongoing scaling or storage growth in this environment.

Interim Period: During the migration, resource utilization may remain stable or slightly fluctuate, but no significant long-term growth is anticipated.

Capacity Management: HPA remains in place to handle short-term demand spikes during the transition period.
