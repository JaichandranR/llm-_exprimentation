h1. Disaster Recovery Plan for Iceberg Tables (AWS S3 + Glue Catalog)

---

h2. Setup Overview
- Source Region: us-east-1
- Destination Region: us-west-2
- Iceberg table data stored in S3
- Table definitions managed in Glue Catalog
- Buckets and KMS keys are region-specific

---

h2. DR Strategy Options

h3. I. Only Replicate S3 Files

*Steps:*
- Enable Cross-Region Replication (CRR) for Iceberg data buckets.
- Ensure metadata/, snapshots/, data/ folders are included.
- Maintain different KMS keys for source and destination regions.
- No Glue Catalog replication.

*Recovery:*
- Manually inspect replicated metadata/ folder.
- Identify latest metadata.json.
- Manually recreate Glue tables in us-west-2.

*Pros:* Simple setup.

*Cons:* Manual recovery, high RTO (6–24 hours).

*Best for:* Non-critical systems.

---

h3. II. Replicate S3 Files + Glue Catalog (Recommended)

*Steps:*
- Enable Cross-Region Replication for S3.
- Periodically export Glue databases and tables using AWS CLI or boto3.
- Adjust metadata_location paths if bucket or prefix changed.
- Import Glue databases and tables into us-west-2.

*Recovery:*
- Immediately use Glue Catalog in us-west-2.
- Query replicated Iceberg tables with minimal delay.

*Pros:* Fast recovery (RTO 5–10 minutes), reliable.

*Cons:* Need automation scripts for Glue metadata export/import.

*Best for:* Production systems requiring high availability.

---

h3. III. Create Iceberg Table Metadata Manually

*Steps:*
- Inspect replicated S3 metadata folder.
- Open latest metadata.json manually.
- Reconstruct schema and table definition.
- Create new Glue tables manually pointing to replicated metadata.json.

*Recovery:*
- Full manual reconstruction.

*Pros:* Works if no other backup is available.

*Cons:* Extremely slow, high chance of errors.

*Best for:* Emergency fallback only.

---

h2. Additional Notes
- KMS keys must be region-specific.
- Cross-region replication must specify ReplicaKmsKeyID.
- Glue Catalog is regional; no native cross-region replication.
- Recommended to script periodic metadata backup.

h2. Quick Strategy Comparison

| Strategy | Setup Complexity | Recovery Speed | Manual Work | Best For |
|:---------|:-----------------|:---------------|:------------|:---------|
| Only replicate S3 | Low | Slow (hours) | High | Non-critical apps |
| Replicate S3 + Glue | Medium | Fast (minutes) | Low | Production critical systems |
| Manual recreate | None | Very slow (manual) | Extremely High | Last resort |

---

h2. Final Recommendation
- Implement S3 replication with appropriate encryption keys.
- Automate Glue metadata backup and replication.
- Validate table accessibility in us-west-2 periodically.
- Document recovery procedures clearly.

---

h2. Optional Next Steps
- Automate Glue metadata backup via boto3 scripts.
- Terraform setup for S3 buckets, replication, IAM roles.
- Create DR runbooks for faster operational response.
